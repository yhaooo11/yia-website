                        <h2>Senior Pen Pal</h2>
                        Over the past weeks, members of Youth in Action have been paired with seniors at local retirement homes to write personalised letters to. <br><br>
                        
                        Through this, we have been able to connect with some of the most isolated and vulnerable members of our community. <br><br>

                        The hope is that the letters bring connections and joy to seniors who need support. <br><br>

                        The Youth in Action leadership group, in partnership with Cards Against Cancer Organization generously gifted handmade origami cranes to be displayed in hospitals and schools across Metro Vancouver. <br><br>

                        This project aims to bring awareness to the effects of paediatric cancer. <br><br>
                        
                        The crane is a symbol of hope and has a deep history in Japanese culture. <br><br>

                        🎬Youth in Action presents our short film “Ubuntu”🎬 <br><br>

                        “Ubuntu” was organized, storyboarded, filmed, and edited over the course of the 2020 summer. This short film represents our group’s collaborative efforts during unprecedented times. The film’s main theme emphasizes the importance of empathy and community responsibility. When we are shown compassion, we are inspired to be compassionate to others. ‘Ubuntu’ is a Zulu word that means ‘I am because we are’.
                        We hope that our video inspires others to do the same and build a stronger community for everyone.<br><br>
                        
                        This piece was also our submission to a video contest and was featured as one of the finalists!<br><br>
